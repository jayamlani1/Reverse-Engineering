Contestants are provided with an executable file and are asked to run the program on a server hosting the file, nc ctf.battelle.org 30041. I am also attaching the exectuable for everyone to try.

You will need Ghidra to get more information about what is happening in the executable. 
If you do not have Ghidra Installed on your system please follow : https://ghidra-sre.org/ and https://ghidra-sre.org/InstallationGuide.html#Install guide to install ghidra on your system.

Ghidra needs JDK 11+, so you will also need to install jdk 11. 

After you start Ghidra, Start a new non-shared project. Open the project and select code browse.
A new window will open here you need to select import file and now import the .exe or .elf file we are interested in. Here it will be the The_Chest.elf file.

Now, first jump to the main function, this can be found on left hand side panel under Symbol Tree --> functions


void main(void)
{
  puts("Greetings traveler!");
  puts(
      "We have found this mysterious Chest! there appears to be a bunch of numbered buttons on the t op"
      );
  puts("maybe you can help us identify the correct order to press them.");
  puts("");
  ask_for_buttons();
  return;
}

Here the main function calls, ask_for_buttons(). So let's jump to the function def of ask_for_buttons():
You will see following of interest code:
  puts("What is the correct sequence?");
  gets((char *)&local_108);
  pcVar1 = strstr((char *)&local_108,"12345 wow I have the same combination on my luggage!");
  if (pcVar1 == (char *)0x0) {
    puts("That didn\'t seem to work...");
  }
  else {
    the_chest_opens();
  }

There is a function call strstr, you can either check the man page or google how the function works. This would give you a clue that to get the answer you need to type:
12345 wow I have the same combination on my luggage!

Now run the executable or visit the server which is hosting the application and provide the following string as input. And you will get your flag.
